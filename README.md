# MLB_Stats_Program
Personal project that I made using WPF that uses C# and SQLite to present information from the lahman2016 baseball stats database.

There are 2 types of searches, player based and team based.  Player search requires at least the first 2 letters from the first or last name.  Team search uses year and team name to get statistics.
